            <h4>DeskTime introduces the new Booking featurex</h4>
            <p>Users can now book desks, meeting rooms, parking spaces, and much more. All bookings are updated in real-time and can be viewed from a single booking grid. It's the best way to manage shared and hybrid workspaces, and another step closer to DeskTime becoming an all-in-one office management system.</p>
